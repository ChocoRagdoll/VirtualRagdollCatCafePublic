This is the initial version (V0.1) of Ragdoll CatCafe, which includes the design of the icon and the actual pet with some basic movements. 

Run the CatCafe.exe in the CatCafe folder to start the program.

Current issues

- The application uses a transparent window for cuteness. We plan to add a Close button in the status board panel. However, since the status board is not 

yet inlcluded, the suggested way to close the program is to use Task Manager. 

    - If you are using the latest build of Win11, you can open Task Manager by right clicking your taskbar and selecting Task Manager. In the prompted 

    window, search for CatCafe.exe using the search bar at top. You could then select the application and click End Task to kill the cat. 

    - Notice that the CatCafe.exe is running under the Background Processes category. 

    - If the above method failed, or you are using Win10, you can press "Ctrl + Alt + Del" to find the "Open Task Manager" option. 

- The size of the cat is not yet adjustable. Rest assured as we will be updating thif feature soon as stated in the Milestone 1 readme.
